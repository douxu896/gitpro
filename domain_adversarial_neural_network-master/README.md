## Content

* ``DANN.py`` contains the learning algorithm. The ``fit()`` function is a very straightforward implementation of *Algorithm 1* of the paper.

* ``experiments_amazon.py`` contains an example of execution on the *Amazon sentiment analysis* dataset (a copy of the dataset files is contained in the folder ``data``). Computes the target test risk (see Table 1 of the paper) and the *Proxy-A-Distance* (see Figure 3 of the paper).

* ``experiments_moons.py`` contains the code used to produce Figure 2 of the paper (experiments on the *inter-twinning moons* toy problem).

* ``mSDA.py`` contains the functions used to generate the mSDA representations (these are literal translations of Chen et al. (2012) Matlab code)
